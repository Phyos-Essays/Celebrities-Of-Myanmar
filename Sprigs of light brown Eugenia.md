## Sprigs of light brown Eugenia

	On his head
	And on my head.

	The sprig of light brown Eugenia,
	The flower of Shwebo,
	offered by our mother, Burmania in our nation
	Looks still fresh.

	Nay giving up!
	The sound of time-signal drum
	From the royal tower, be soon heard
	While gentle breeze is caressing.

	When the cocks crows at dawn
	Joyfully we shall meet in the field
	To strike the royal drum victoriously at daybreak,
	Looking forward to beat the drum.
	With the sprig of light brown Eugenia,
	Let's  march together!
