## Different People in Different Culture

Flames are dancing in the fireplace. Winter’s stormy wind, blowing here and there in dark, is wrestling with the smokes in the chimney. I am sleepy near the fireplace.

I listen to their conversations carefully. However, I can’t understand them well. Only after thinking about them, I can realize a little bit about what they are talking. Sometimes, I just smile as soon as they beam and, frown when they grimace, pretending to comprehend what they are saying. However, it is tasteless. They will also think about my saying in the same way.

According to our tradition, when having food, we serve it to elders first. But, for them, they hand over me the food first. Sometimes, I can’t enjoy it comfortably. Only after taking the food what I want, elders and others take the rest. How it’s so difficult.

We eat our food, drinking the broth, mixing with cooked pieces. But they take in another way; they enjoy cooked pieces of meat, fish, vegetables in a curry, only after having soup with no salt and cooking oil. I yearn the taste of ripen tamarind. I long for rice and warm curry.

We take food what we want with our own mind, taking this plate and that plate. We just finish our hunger in any good way. How it is so free! But, they can’t fulfill their hunger unless they say these words very often: “May I take a pinch of salt, please.”, “Excuse me!”, and “Thank you.” on the table. These effusive words can’t be uttered easily from my lips. Only after endeavoring to say these words, they stammer out. I am wondering it might be better to smile situationally rather than saying the word “Thank you!” in a fabricated way. I can’t decide.

It is not easy for me to translate my words in mind to adapt with their words. It is also difficult for me to try to comprehend their words by translating into my language. I can’t translate the word “Phonegyi” to make them understand what I mean. I find it is not true to translate a word in their language “Nat”.

How it is tight to wrap my hands, legs and body from dawn to dusk. It is so uncomfortable to suffer chest and back pains. Wool clothes are itching. It is really uncomfortable not to squat down, not to stretch, and not to lie on back. It is not relaxed to incline and twist all day. My trousers don’t let me to sit cross-legged in private.

When I visit somewhere, children look at me (as if I were an alien)* and adults smile at me without any reason. How it is bad to be stared though I am a good man.

It is suffocated to live either in a house or a room where doors and windows are closed.

I will suffer a lapse in my work when I mind their customs. When I live in my own ways, I will receive their derisive smiles. They are not mindful of my tradition but I have to be careful of their norms. It is a burden on me. Is it better that the yellow one tries to understand about the white one and the white one to the yellow one? Both rice and wheat give nutrients to us.

In the fireplace, the heat is gradually decreasing. Winter’s stormy wind is now calm. The time has come to midnight. I, accompanying to a hot-water bottle, am also trying to fall asleep under thick blankets in my stuffy room.
