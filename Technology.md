	Human beings and technical inventions; how they make people socially less interactive

Today is technology age. Everything surrounding us and our environment is concerned with technology.
Technology is the combination of skills, ideas, and innovative thoughts.
The product of technology expands from controlling the fire to exploring new planets in the Galaxy.
And, in saying, technical inventions, from micro-SD cards to satellites and rockets also include.
All of technical inventions appear of the human, for the human, by the human.
So, they give both advantages and disadvantages to their users.

It is the law of nature everything in the world has its own causes and effects, dark sides, and bright sides.
Like that, technical inventions also have their own causes and effects.
It can clearly be seen technical inventions have good impacts to their clients.
But, what is going to be discussed here is how they affect their users in some negative ways.
Among them, how they make people socially less interactive will be mentioned.

In saying human beings, it can be categorized into three groups; childhood, young age or adulthood and the old.
These three groups have their own society and they, linking with technical inventions, suffer from how these thins make them socially less interactive.

Firstly, the first stage of human beings, childhood is suffering from how technical inventions make human beings socially less interactive.

In earlier times, youths liked to gather around at some place and discuss some informative issues, like politics, economics, beliefs, and also world affairs.
They shared their views frankly and friendly and they enjoyed up-to-date information from each other.
