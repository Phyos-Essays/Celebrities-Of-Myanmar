The Parachuted President

“Ring, Ring, Ring”, a telephone was ringing incessantly in the office of the minister for transportation around 11a.m on the 17th of February of 1957.

A private secretary for the transportation minister answered the phone,

“This is the private secretary for the transportation minister speaking.
How can I help you?”

“This is the private secretary for the Chairman of AFPFL.
Would you mind handing over the phone to the minister, please?” the other side replied.

“Hold on a moment, sir” the first person asked and handed over to the minister’s office.

After a moment, an authoritative voice answered the phone,

“This is Mahn Win Maung speaking.”

“Sir, the Chairman invites you to see him in his office at 12a.m tomorrow, the 18th of February.
So, please come and see him on that time, sir” the secretary of the Chairman said about the invitation of U Nu, the Chairman of AFPFL.

“Thank you, I will be there tomorrow.” the minister replied.

At that time, the Premier U Nu was busy reorganizing his AFPFL party.
