## The Poem in a Museum

Everyone calls me “Poem”. My lord who created me is U Cinta. As he was His Majesty’s poet laureate, either inside of the palace or outside, there was no one who didn’t know him.

At that time, he decorated me with the best words from ancient treatises. When he was going to have me recited in the presence of His Majesty, he used to beautify me with the finest decorated words, which were just like glittering necklaces, scouring the ancient scrolls in the royal library. My voice became as loud as the roar of a lion king.

When I recited (what my lord composed) in the presence of His Majesty, my voice thundered and echoed the whole palace. My recited voices were so authoritative and bold that everyone in the palace with the exception of His Majesty could not manage to vie with me but bowed down before mine. Among them, even my lord, the poet laureate U Cinta himself did so.

His Majesty was very pleased with my recitation because I was composed about how His Majesty’s power was spreading the whole universe, how he was so powerful as much as the glory of the Sun, how he was ruling his kingdom well, following the ten precepts incumbent on a king, how his kingdom was getting adequate rainfall, and how his kingdom was so prosperous that there were no crimes in it. Oh my! U Cinta was awarded various gifts - gold, silver, sarongs, and turbans by His Majesty. My lord seemed so pleased.

Day by day, my lord decorated me more with the sacred words from Pali, Sanskrit languages and from the Puranas. He also practiced me to have a sound as roar as thunder. He had me practiced the blustering sound that anyone couldn’t manage to raise their heads. When His Majesty had Nan-O monastery built and donated it, I had to record His Majesty’s merits by praising how beautifully this monastery was built. Then, I had to chant a song on how His Majesty dammed up Shi-Shar Lake. When His Majesty conquered Amaravadi, I had to recite Maw-Kun (a record poem) on his achievement. When the royal ceremony of putting the princess Siricanda to sleep in a cradle was held, I had to present Siricanda E-Chin. My songs composed by the poet laureate weren’t able to cease in the palace and it wasn’t enough for His Majesty to praise my lord’s poetry composing skills. Various titles were bestowed upon my lord by His Majesty.

So, U Cinta became a renowned poet laureate in the palace. Not very soon, a letter arrived from his mother who was living in the countryside.

Only then, U Cinta remembered that he was originally from the countryside and how he became a poet laureate. The memory that he was to be a famous scholar after learning in the monastery of Shwe-Bone-Tar appeared in his mind. He recalled his memory that he became His Majesty’s poet laureate after serving as a royal clerk under Minister Dhammapala and offering a congratulating poem about the ruler’s glory to His Majesty.

It had been a very long time he forgot about his old mother in the country for he was busy finding words well suited to the ears of His Majesty.

After receiving his mother’s letter, he remembered how his mother was struggling for her life; gardening and weaving mats.

My lord was gazing unconsciously, leaving parabaiks.  At that time, he was decorating me with the jewel like words from Sanskrit treatises. Then, he took a decorated cart to get to the village beneath the hill of Mingalargiri.

Epic poems about the King’s glory, Maw-Kun, E-chin were no more in his mind. Sanskrit words and Magadha words disappeared from his mind. I was wondering whether he still remembered me, his clone.

After our cart, jingling its small bells, passed through the fields of corns, sesame, peanuts, cottons and tobacco plants, we arrived at the small village. Then we headed to his mother’s home.

His mother was waiting for him in front of a small shack. His mother was so thin that my lord U Cinta would not believe she was his mother for she was as slim as a dry branch.

His mother seemed eager to pay attention to the recitation of her son’s poems and to see her son’s honor as a poet laureate. Villagers were beside his mother and they too were so thrilled to hear their respected poet’s poetry.

It was time for me to show what I could do. My lord had me recited in the same way I did in the presence of His Majesty; how our King achieved great victories,  how he was so generous, how he was ruling his kingdom according to Dharma, the truth, how he was endeavoring to make his  realm more prosperous, and so on. 

Though it came to an end, his mother and the villagers didn’t seem they knew what I performed. They, gazing somewhere, could not decide whether to applause me or to give remarks to me. His mother was staring at him in awe with eyes popping out.

An old uncle could make a remark “Well, your poetry didn’t seem well suited to our ears but to the royal ears. We can’t make any judgments on your works.” Apparently, everyone seemed to agree with him.

However, his mother looked not too happy. My lord thought his creation of poems could make his mother pleased, delightful, and motivated. But, his mother now seemed less happy. His mother might wonder his son’s created works weren’t for them at all. My lord U Cinta felt shameful and sorry. He also witnessed the lives of the villagers and his mother’s life.

Then, he paid obedience to his mother and went back to the palace. He returned to the palace, thinking about the tough lives of poor villagers who could not stand the glory of the King.

Since that day, the songs of U Cinta were no more heard in the palace. It was heard that His Majesty said “U Cinta is so old that his poetic intellectual skills are now scarce.” U Cinta, thinking something and gazing somewhere, left me in the hail of parabaiks and I had to sing no more.

Now, it has been a very long time. My lord passed away. It has been for ages His Majesty fell in the outlying areas of his kingdom where he was suppressing a group of rebellions. 

For me, I was left behind only in the hail of parabaiks. But, not very soon, a young researcher came across me there and said “Oh my! This is U Cinta’s poem”. He also cleaned the dust on me and held me softly. I missed my lord U Cinta. So, I recited what my lord wrote on me for that young researcher. Though my voice was not too pleasant for it had been for many years I didn’t have a chance to recite them, he listened to me patiently.

“It’s not bad. Though the style of composition is perfect and rich in words, I don’t think it might be useful for today. But, there is one thing it might be better for it to be in a museum.” Because of his kindness, I was shifted from the home of U Cinta to a museum. Now, I am in a mirror-fronted cupboard in the secluded corner of the museum.
