“To Dispel Anger”

It is the law of nature that
One’s sure to lose what he gets
While the other’s good fortune at.
It’s like the mounti’g bubble up
That’s transient only for mome’t,
On the surface of ocean, that
The King’s dwelling happily at
The top of golden palace, surrounded
By counselors, in enjoyment.

For now, though thou sparest my life,
With great mercy, it is desti’ed
To decay one day, as all of we,
Beings, inevitably, to be.

I, Thy slave, beg and bow down Thee.
In cycle of rebirth, if we
Again meet even, I do give
Forgiveness but do not give
Revenge, with my due respect
Thee, as the blood is impermane’t
Flows in my body, as eleme’ts.
