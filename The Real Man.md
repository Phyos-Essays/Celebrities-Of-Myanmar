## The Real Man

Ba Htun has no idea what to do. As it is 11p.m and the moon doesn’t shine her rays very well, the street is really dark. His motorcar is very diligent not to move, being careless to be soothed and irritated. He can’t stop other cars on the way to assist him. There is only one bus which is driving so onrushing that he can’t make it stopped.

There is no better choice for him than that he has to sleep in his car, which is laborious not to shift on the way between Insein and Mhawbhi.

After giving up absolutely all of his wills about his car, he approaches a dark compound nearby, seeing some light in there.

Near a small house, suddenly he shouts: “Please check there is a dog!”

“Who is it? There aren’t any dogs here” replies a person from the downstairs of the house, holding up a lamp.

Under the light of the lamp, Ba Htun  feels something in his mind, seeing a young ladies really dainty face.

He is amazed and stas neither too far nor too close.

Then, he says “I come from Prome and just drop in as my car broke down. I don’t know what to do. This house is the only house I can find around here.”

“Where  is your car? Are you alone?”says the young lady.

“I’m alone. Tonight is so bad”, he says.

The young lady waits for a second before she says: “So, what will you do?”

“No idea. But I would be grateful if I could take a stay here for tonight.” he replies.

The young lady thinks for a while.

“If so, let me tell to my …ah… my husband.” she says and goes upstairs.

The house is just like a small batten house. After a while, the young lady comes down again and says

“My…ah…my husband told me you may stay here. Now, what will you do about your car?”

“My car is an Austen. It can be brought here by pushing.” he answers.

“Where?” she asks again and leaves the house.

Seeing the hospitality of the young lady, Ba Htun feels cheered up, takes the lamp from her and follows after her. He tells her, he feels awkward disturbing her.

“Never mind. My husband is such a spastic patient that he has to lie in his bed and he can’t help you”, the young lady replies.

Later, Ba Htun brings his car by pushing it. The young lady makes the way for him.

When they are home, she asks: “Have you finished your supper?”

“I didn’t carry any edible things as I thought to have my dinner after I get to Yangon.” he answers.

“If so, how convenient! I prepared food as if there were any guests. However, they didn’t come. So, take a seat.” she says pointing to the divan. Leaving the lamp on the divan, she goes upstairs as agilely as a doe. Then, all the foods have been prepared on the divan.

Ba Htun is amazed to see the prepared food and he is thinking about it. The young lady seems to be over twenty years old and she doesn’t look like a country girl. It is more wonderful that foods are high standard. They are bread, luncheon meat, sausage and sauce, and a couple of spoon and fork.

Ba Htun, asking anything, is having his dinner, taking a glance very often to the young lady, whom he thinks is really beautiful with the behavior of appreciation to her. The young lady takes a seat beside Ba Htun and says

“Enjoy your dinner. Don’t feel backward. Eating is not the thing to be shameful.”

“Oh, no!.I don’t. When I am hungry, my mouth is really eager to have food.

“As it is my nature that I like to eat the best food, this situation is like coming across a lady while scouring a girl. By the way, how long have your husband been sick? And what is his name.” he says.

“He is called Ko Ba Saw. He has been sick for ah… 3 months. By the way,as a bowl of cooked rice is unavailable, are you content with your hunger?I prepared only the curries for I am thinking to cook the rice only when they arrive.”she replies.

“Oh, this has fulfilled my hunger. The bread is still fresh.” he says.

“I bought them today as I arrived from Yangon. Now it is better that you come than they don’t drop in.” she says

“I think they will come tomorrow” he says.

“No, I don’t think so. The school is open. They are teachers. “She says.

“Ah, like that? If so, this is the good deed.” he say and feels sympathy for Ko Be Saw.

“Quiet place, isn’t it? But the patient feels alone. Are you two alone?”

“Right now, we two are alone. The two young housemaids have gone to their native. By the way, you should sleep on the dais. It is good for you that you can take a look to your car.” she says and makes the bed on the dais.
