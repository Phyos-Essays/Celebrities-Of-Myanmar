My parents are U Tin Maung Swe and Daw Khin Aye Than. I passed my matriculation exam in 2012. Since the end of 2012, I had been studying at English Department of Yadanabon University. In August of 2014, I founded an academic group called Society of English Literature and Language to practice English better together. This society is still well working for our department and students. I often write articles to cover in newspapers. Most of them are in English and some of them are translated versions of renowned essays by famous Myanmar writers. Now, I live in Anisakhan and am writing articles, essays ,and poetry in English to publish in some periodicals.
