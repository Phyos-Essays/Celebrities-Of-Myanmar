## A brief biography of the author

My name is *Pyae Phyo* - and as I am still young, my people call me *Maung Pyae Phyo*.

At [Yadanabon University, Amarapura](http://www.ydbu.edu.mm/) I am a Honors student specializing in English .

In 1997 I was born in Anisakhan, [Pyin Oo Lwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyin_Oo_Lwin), Mandalay Region. My parents are U Tin Maung Swe and Daw Khin Aye Than.

In 2012 I passed my matriculation exam, and since then I had been studying at the English Department of [Yadanabon University](http://www.ydbu.edu.mm/).

In August 2014 I founded an academic group called the *Society of English Literature and Language* to practice English together. This society is well working in our department for our students.

Now, living in Anisakhan, I often write articles: *essays* and *poems* in English, and I *translate* renowned essays of famous Myanmar writers - published in selected periodicals and newspapers.
