## A brief biography of the author

My name is *Pyae Phyo* - and as I am still young, my people call me *Maung Pyae Phyo*.

At [Yadanabon University, Amarapura](http://www.ydbu.edu.mm/) I am a Honors student specialized in English language and literature.

In 1997 I was born in [Anisakhan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anesakhan/@21.9797821,96.3890061,14z/data=!4m8!1m2!3m1!2sAnesakhan!3m4!1s0x30cb628195012187:0xfefb9d72145eeb93!8m2!3d21.9765983!4d96.4024115), [Pyin Oo Lwin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyin_Oo_Lwin), Mandalay Region to my parents *U Tin Maung Swe* and *Daw Khin Aye Than*.

In 2012 I passed my matriculation exam, and study since then at the English Department of [Yadanabon University](http://www.ydbu.edu.mm/).

In 2014 I founded an academic group called the *Society of English Literature and Language* to practice English together. This society is well working in our university department for our students.

In 2018 I was among eight students chosen to represent Myanmar at an ASEAN convention in Japan.

I love to write: *Essays* and *Poems* - also in  English, and I *translate* renowned works of famous Burmese writers. Several articles of mine got published in selected periodicals and newspapers.
