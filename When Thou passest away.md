## When Thou passest away

	Oh, it's true to grow old,
	To suffer from pains and
	to pass away in the abode of human.

	Even though, when thou passest away
	The motherland thou wert born
	Should be left with improvements.

	Thy own nationals, language and literature
	Should also be left with well development.

	May the Dhamma, the light of truth
	And the pagoda where thou bowest down
	In worship and sharest merits,
	Also be effulgently left.
