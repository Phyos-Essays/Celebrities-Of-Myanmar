## Zaw Gyi’s Literary Discussion
or
## Tea Time

	“If thou hast a cup of green tea,
	Truly, the glory will be brought,
	All great idea will be accomplished.”

This quotation mentioned above is taken from a Myanmar traditional poem called Laysitt (kind of four stanzed), which was composed in Mandalay Era, highlighting the advantages of having a cup of tea. Analyzing its theme is preferable. This verse might to say it is auspicious to have a cup of green tea.

According to Myanmar custom, the tea time is in the morning. The place to have green tea is the Eain-Oo-Khan (Eastern part of a house).So, the poet seems to describe that having a cup of green tea is auspicious. Moreover, as having green tea means grouping together more than three or four men rather than having alone, more than a piece of idea are available for more than three or four men are being gathered. It will be easier for whether solving the problems, or considering some issue as it means one man with one idea. So, the poet also seems to say having green tea will make the great idea accomplished.

Tea time is a kind of round table discussion. However, it partially differs from that meaning. Saying discussion, it may mean political discussion or a way of challenging before negotiation .It may apparently mean more formal with strict rules and regulations. So, tea time sounds emotionally uncomfortable. And, of course, it is even to be afraid of .Tea time is actually unaware of both politics and challenging each other in formal ways with table manners. It is simply meant to be more free, more comfortable and relaxed. Besides, there is quid pro quo, tolerance, affection and open conversation .These ways of saying are under the term “Tea time”.

Hearing the word “Tea time”, it can be seen that sitting around centralizing the tea pot, saying effusive words each other, joyful conversations, and the freedom for everyone to take part in discussion and to leave whenever they wish. In truth, “Tea time” is a formal discussion though it seems to be undisciplined.

In this kind of discussion, it is witty, rhetorical, and it also makes the great idea to be leaked, it makes better literary ideas emerged, it lights over the unrevealed issues, it solves the lumpy issues, it reveals the undiscovered things and it makes clear the perplexed ones.

In this kind of discussion, the custom of sharing the knowledge of Buddhist Philosophy (Abbhidhamma), Myanmar History, and poetic philosophy, the ancient tradition of Myanmar people, handed to the generations after generations, can be noticed. This custom can be seen yet either in wedding ceremony or in funeral or in the shrine room or on the rest houses in monastic compound.

This custom can also be found as an example in the novel “Mhar-Daw-Bhone”by Mr.Maung Mhaing. In that novel, the main characters, former Bagayar monk U Kyaw Dhawy, Abbhidhamma Sayar Aye, Shwe Mhan Maung Maung Ywa, and Maung Phone Myint are the participants in the tea time. Bagayar former monk U Kyaw Dhway,who knows a lot of things ,who can share his wide knowledge  and who scold the other participants is the moderator .Maung Phone Myint is able to ask so many elicit questions, to angle for information. Though Sayar Aye and Maung Maung Ywa mock   the other and quibble over the issues what the others are conferring with, they two sometimes are humiliated by U Kyaw Dhawy. However, tea time is witty, pleasant, pleasure and lively.

One day, I dropped in a tea time. Actually, there was neither tea pot nor hors d’oeuvre .However; it was same as the tea time. It was preferable to have green tea. In that tea time, the participants were over twenties, over fifties, over thirties, retired men, teachers, writers and even students.

What they were conferring were not very well organized and they were discussing this and that.The participants did not come on the formal appointment and they just joined the gathering, without thinking already what to say in it but they just came across that gathering.

In that discussion, the participants sometimes journey back to the history.

Sometimes, they put on makeup on the face of the modern literature. Sometimes, they take shelter under the cool shadow of the classical literature. A person who flatters the other also involves while a person who says simperingly may take part in a tea time. Not only a person who speaks disagreeably but also a person who answers back wearing smile can be seen in that tea time. In the tea time, one man might think from the beginning while other might be thinking either in the middle of certain issues or against the end of those issues. A person might want to show the others that he is well educated while the others might be paying attention to him only with smiles, but waiting to attack him when his weakness is seen. In this way, the essence of literature rises from being buried, then to its peak. In the other words, I am wondering that tea time is a way to look for the ecstasy of life.

Kyat wine (setting up game cocks to fight) is a popular ritual in Myanmar. It is said that Kyat wine can be seen in every parts of Myanmar. It is being wondered it is better to hold tea time in every parts of Myanmar than to set up Kyat wine. Though police might be waiting to catch the gamblers in Kyat wine, they are not doing so in tea time. However, the people setting up tea time are surely caught by the literary spirit .A person who is really getting caught by that literary spirit is a literary lunatic.

So, the one thing to keep in mind before kicking off  a tea time  is you won’t be able to count zealously Kyat,Mat,Mhuu,Pya,Pound,Shilling,Penny,and Dollar with precise statics. In other words, you will be neither the ignorant, arrogant and petulant follower after money nor the power-mad person who is after the power, hectoring the other.
