## Goodwill or Suffering

Environment mends people in some way.
It mends more immature and young people than experienced one.
Than the young, it mends more inexperienced children.
By chances, I estimate the relationship between children and their environment.
These children imitate their environment.

For example, look the children living in a police station.
They mimic the styles and behaviors of staffs and police officers.

When they meet each other, they often play “police vs. thieves”.
If a group takes the role of the police, the left plays as thieves.
In playing so, there are more children who want to be police than to play the role of thieves.
Apparently, they accept a belief in their mind that a thief is an evil and a police officer is the one who captures this evil.
The children who play as thieves run away and the police team arrest them.
Sometimes, the ways; they manacle the thieves, they escort them,
they interrogate them, they torture them when they don’t receive confession, are so animated.

In the same way, the children living in a hospital play the games related to medicine and surgery;
taking the role of a doctor, the role of patients, injecting, doing surgery, giving medicines and etc.
So, by mimicking their environment, their seeds of habit root in their mind.
It is natural that the future lives of children grow developed depending on the good and bad points of their environment.
Depending on the admonition of their parents,
the guarding of their relatives,
and the ways of their friends,
the future of children falls like yellow leaves falling from tree,
and their future becomes as bright as stars in the sky.
According to my habit, I feel cheerful when I see promising children
and when I see incapable ones, I feel down-hearted.

Last year (1963-1964), I left Yangon for Mawlamyaing very often and vice versa.
The times I visited there was so many.
Every times, I took train.
It was so boring that I gazed somewhere when I felt bored on the train.
Along the way, creeks, ponds, fields, and golden pagodas could be found.
But, these views could not draw my attention every times.
What attracted my attention were the small villages between Ta-Hton and Hnin-Palae.
These small villages were not too far from each other.
These intermittent villages along the railway were not too impressive.
Most of the buildings were just thatches.
People living there might probably be peasants.
As a highway was in the east of the villages,
some might be vendors selling chewing betel, cheroots or confectionery.
Assuming all round villages, these villages were poor ones.
When a train arrived at their villages, children from all of these villages were massively waiting for it.
They were in different ages; from 5 years old to 13 or 14 years old.
Some were naked, and some were with dirty sarongs or untidy shorts.
Most of them didn’t wear any shirts.

They happily yelled, waved their hands and joyfully jumped as soon as a train arrived.
Whenever my train passed this place, I used to gaze out of the window.
Not only me, but also other passengers fixed their eyes on them.
For the first time I had been there, I thought it might be the nature of children to enjoy the chugging of locomotives or  steamships.

When they were seen, the commuters from the train I took might to offer them what they had.
So, they generously gave away their snacks; sweets, chocolates, steamed glutinous rice, edible succulent tuber and steamed corns to  the children asking something beside the railway.
Some offered coinages.
When something was given from the train, children were busy robbing it.

Then, they were left behind noisily, and crowdedly.
The passengers were delightful for what they had done and they also wished repeatedly for it.
But, for me, I could be neither happy nor having desire to say “Well done”.

Though the train passed these villages, that scene didn’t fade away in my eyes.
Along my journey, I was thinking about the future of those children.

There are more than six trains which passed these villages.
These kids will only be waiting for trains as they realize they can get money or something edible else.
For them, study times, play times and school are less interesting than the time trains arrive at their villages.
Besides, the bad concept that they can fulfill their hunger without tireless, will be in their mind.
Then, the bad mind; not having any intention to rely on self, not realizing to learn and study, unknowing to work for life, will destroy their future.
That the children’s future is ruined means the future of our nation is destroyed.

We Myanmar can be proud of being generous and charitable.
However, we donate only with a belief “If I offer something, I will achieve good deeds”.
They satisfy with that idea.
This satisfaction depends only on the temporary delight, happiness, and being pleased of the children they offered but not on lifelong delight, happiness, and being pleased.
They seem not to notice that fact.

Anyway, I don’t want to comment on the goodwill of benefactors.
It can be said that it is noble.
Nevertheless, I assume they should think about donations which can make children happy for their long lives rather than one which only make them happy for awhile.

Though it might be deemed that his kind of contribution is impossible at once, if we saved money we donated there every day systematically, would there be a school, or a library, or a hospital?
